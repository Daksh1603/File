# INCF

The following repo only contains the code for conversion of data for cross examination . I decided not to include the Data,Stimulus and the .nwb files since they are larger in size.

Link for the [dataset]() .

The nwb_info.py from the NWB folder is taken from [NWBShowcase](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/NWBShowcase) . Many thanks to Padraig Gleeson , Vergil R. Haynes , Abhineet Pandey and Filippo Ledda for providing this script .

This project is **not complete** and is just the start to the greatness that comes along with it . This repo is created with the aim as to provide mentors with analysing and determing if I am on the right track .
